CODENAME LIST (Updated as of 9-14-25)
----------------------------------------------------------------
# EXPLANATION:
# When using Option 1 of the script, it renames wems from the Media folder and organzies them into folders.
# This file determines what key terms in filenames are matched to which folders
# Below, you will see terms like "_SYVO_" behind colons
# That is the term that the script will look for in the file name 
# On the other side of the colon, you will see stuff like "SOUND - Narrator"
# That will be the name of the folder in which files with that term in their name will be placed 
# So a file that has "_SYVO_" in it's name will be placed into the "SOUND - Narrator" folder 
# Simple enough (hopefully)
# You can add your own terms and folder names easily, just follow the same exact structure 
# If you want, you can change these pre-existing terms/folder names, but I do not recommend that 

# If you haven't noticed, some of these sentences have started with a hashtag
# That is because the script will ignore lines that start with a hashtag /EVEN IF that line includes a colon/
# This allows you to make notes underneath entries in case you want to...well, leave a note lol
# Technically, the script will ignore ANY line /that DOESN'T contain a colon/
# But the hashtag adds that one extra bit of ignoring to the script's logic 
# But yeah, that's about all that needs to be explained. Have fun modding!
# Oh, one more thing 
# The WEM-ID-CHART.txt has a list of all renamed wems next to their original wem ID number
# You can use that for reference or whatever. Also, Option 102 of the script will utilize that txt for searches

----------------------------------------------------------------
# NOTE:
# The majority of the notes I've added by default use HWOARANG as a test character to determine what sounds are activated when 
# Some of the information might be inaccurate for other characters, so adjust as needed (and let us know in the Tekken modding discord lol)
# These notes are also kinda old LOL Some stuff may have changed since I originally wrote them, idk. Don't got time to test
